## Python classes


**0-square.py:** Writing an empty class Square that defines a square:
You are not allowed to import any module.


**1-square.py:** Writing a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py).
Private instance attribute: size.
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification).
You are not allowed to import any module.
Why?
Why size is private attribute?
The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as class builder, must control the type and value of. this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.


**2-square.py:** Writig a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py).
Private instance attribute: size.
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer.
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0.
You are not allowed to import any module.


**3-square.py:** Writing a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py).
Private instance attribute: size.
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer.
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0.
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area.
You are not allowed to import any module.


**4-square.py:** Writing a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)
Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer.
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0.
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area.
You are not allowed to import any module.
Why?
Why a getter and setter?
Reminder: size is a private attribute. We did that to make sure we control the type and value. Getter and setter methods are not 100% Python, but more OOP. With them, you will be able to validate the assignment of a private attribute and also define how getting the attribute value will be available from outside - by copy? by assignment? etc. Also, adding type/value validation in the setter will centralize the logic, since you will do it in only one place.


**5-square.py**: Writing a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py).
Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer.
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0.
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area.
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line.
You are not allowed to import any module.


**6-square.py:** Writing a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)
Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer.
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0.
Private instance attribute: position:
property def position(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers.
Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area.
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line.
position should be use by using space - Donâ€™t fill lines by spaces when position[1] > 0.
You are not allowed to import any module.


**100-singly_linked_list.py:** Writing a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:
Private instance attribute: data:
property def data(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def data(self, value): to set it:
data must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message data must be an integer.
Private instance attribute: next_node:
property def next_node(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def next_node(self, value): to set it:
next_node can be None or must be a Node, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message next_node must be a Node object.
Instantiation with data and next_node: def __init__(self, data, next_node=None):
And, write a class SinglyLinkedList that defines a singly linked list by:
Private instance attribute: head (no setter or getter).
Simple instantiation: def __init__(self):
Should be printable:
print the entire list in stdout.
one node number by line.
Public instance method: def sorted_insert(self, value): that inserts a new Node into the correct sorted position in the list (increasing order).
You are not allowed to import any module.


**101-square.py:** Writing a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 6-square.py).
Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer.
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0.
Private instance attribute: position:
property def position(self): to retrieve it.
property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integer.
Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area.
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
