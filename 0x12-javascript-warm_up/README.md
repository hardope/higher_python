The first line: “C is fun”.
The second line: “Python is cool”.
The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”.
You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
You are not allowed to use var.
You are not allowed to use any if/else statement.
You can use only one console.log.
You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).


**7-multi_c.js:** Writing a script that prints x times “C is fun”
Where x is the first argument of the script.
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”.
You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
You are not allowed to use var.
You can use only two console.log.
You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).


**8-square.js:** Writing a script that prints a square
The first argument is the size of the square.
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”.

You are not allowed to use var.
You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).


**9-add.js:** Writing a script that prints the addition of 2 integers
The first argument is the first integer.

You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
You are not allowed to use var.


**10-factorial.js:** Writing a script that computes and prints a factorial
The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial.
Factorial of NaN is 1.
You must do it recursively.
You must use a function.
You must use console.log(...) to print all output.
You are not allowed to use var.


**11-second_biggest.js:** Writing a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.
You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer.
If no argument passed, print 0.
