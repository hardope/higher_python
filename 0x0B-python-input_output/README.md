**3-to_json_string.py:** Writing a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string):
Prototype: def to_json_string(my_obj):
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized.


**4-from_json_string.py:** Writing a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string:
Prototype: def from_json_string(my_str):
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object.


**5-save_to_json_file.py:**  Writing a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation:
Prototype: def save_to_json_file(my_obj, filename):
You must use the with statement.
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized.
You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.


**6-load_from_json_file.py:** Writing a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”:
Prototype: def load_from_json_file(filename):
You must use the with statement.
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object.
You don’t need to manage file permissions / exceptions.


**7-add_item.py:** Writing a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file:
You must use your function save_to_json_file from 5-save_to_json_file.py.
You must use your function load_from_json_file from 6-load_from_json_file.py.
The list must be saved as a JSON representation in a file named add_item.json.
If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created.
You don’t need to manage file permissions / exceptions.


**8-class_to_json.py:** Writing a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object:
Prototype: def class_to_json(obj):
obj is an instance of a Class.
All attributes of the obj Class are serializable: list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean.
You are not allowed to import any module.


**9-student.py:** Writing a class Student that defines a student by:
Public instance attributes:
first_name.
last_name.
age.
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py).
You are not allowed to import any module.


**10-student.py:** Writing a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)
Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name.
age.
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attribute names contained in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved
You are not allowed to import any module.


**11-student.py:** Writing a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py).
Public instance attributes:
first_name.
last_name.
age.
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attributes name contain in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved.
Public method def reload_from_json(self, json): that replaces all attributes of the Student instance:
You can assume json will always be a dictionary.
A dictionary key will be the public attribute name.
A dictionary value will be the value of the public attribute.
You are not allowed to import any module.
Now, you have a simple implementation of a serialization and deserialization mechanism (concept of representation of an object to another format, without losing any information and allow us to rebuild an object based on this representation).


**12-pascal_triangle.py:** Technical interview preparation:
You are not allowed to google anything.
Whiteboard first.
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:
Returns an empty list if n <= 0.
You can assume n will be always an integer.
You are not allowed to import any module.


**100-append_after.py:** Writing a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string (see example):
Prototype: def append_after(filename="", search_string="", new_string=""):
You must use the with statement.
You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
You are not allowed to import any module.


**101-stats.py:** Writing a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:
Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>.
Each 10 lines and after a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), prints those statistics since the beginning:
Total file size: File size: <total size>.
where is the sum of all previous (see input format above).
Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500.
if a status code doesn’t appear, don’t print anything for this status code.
format: <status code>: <number>.
status codes should be printed in ascending order.
